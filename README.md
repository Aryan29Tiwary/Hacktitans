# Hacktitans
This project aims to revolutionize the traditional voting system by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of votes. It provides a decentralized, tamper-proof platform where each vote is securely recorded as a block in the blockchain, eliminating risks of vote manipulation, double voting, and unauthorized access. With a web-based interface and role-based access control, voters can cast their votes securely while the system guarantees anonymity and verifiability. The use of smart contracts automates the election process and ensures accurate real-time result counting, making it ideal for institutions, organizations, or even governmental bodies aiming to adopt a trustworthy digital voting solution.
Project Highlights
✅ Decentralized Ledger
All votes are recorded as blocks in a blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

🔐 Secure Voting
Cryptographic hashing and digital signatures prevent vote forgery and ensure voter privacy.

🧾 Tamper-Proof Records
Once a vote is cast, it becomes a permanent and irreversible part of the ledger.

🌐 Web-Based Interface
Simple and intuitive front-end for casting votes and viewing results.

👥 Role-Based Access

Admin: Can add candidates and start/stop the election.

Voters: Can log in and cast a single, verified vote.
How It Works
Voter Registration: Admin registers eligible voters.

Vote Casting: Each voter connects their wallet, authenticates, and casts a vote.

Blockchain Recording: The vote is recorded as a transaction/block.

Immutable Ledger: Once added, votes cannot be changed.

Result Display: Results can be transparently viewed by anyone.
